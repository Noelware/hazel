# This is the configuration properties that you can define for Logback.
# You can override this using the system property: `-Ddev.floofy.hazel.api.logback.config` to
# the path that this is at or using the `HAZEL_LOGBACK_CONFIG_PATH`.
#
# This will also look in `src/main/kotlin/resources/config/logging.properties`.

# This enables a list of encoders that Nino will enable if defined under
# this property. The encoders are:
#
# - Sentry (recommend in prod): Enables the Sentry hook to report errors from the `ERROR` log level
# and report it to Sentry.
#
# - Logstash: Enables the Logstash TCP hook to monitor hazel with the Elastic Stack. hazel
# uses this in production to monitor and check for logs.
#
# Examples:
#     - hazel.encoders=sentry,logstash
#     - hazel.encoders=sentry
hazel.encoders=

# This is the DSN to use when `hazel.encoders` contains the Sentry encoder.
hazel.dsn=

# This is the TCP endpoint to reach when using the Logstash encoder.
hazel.logstash.endpoint=

# Enables verbose logging when printing.
hazel.debug=false
