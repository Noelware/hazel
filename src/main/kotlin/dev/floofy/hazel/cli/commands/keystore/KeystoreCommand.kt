    |The `keystore` command is the main management utility for managing Hazel's keystore.
    |
    |Hazel uses a Java keystore to handle secret key management, SSL certificates for the server,
    |and user persistence without bringing in an external database.
    |
    |To generate a keystore, you can run `hazel keystore generate` to create the keystore in the path
    |and you can load it using the `keystore.path` configuration key.
